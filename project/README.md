# Social topics throughout music: sentiment analysis

## Abstract
In this project, our goal is to find out about the social topics evolution in culture. We will use music lyrics from the “Million song dataset” to analyse sentiment in tracks from artist, genres and time. What can the sentiment towards different topics in songs tell us about people and the time they live in? Our goal is to provide a visualization of semantic trends in music, that hopefully will give people more insight into everyday social topics and how they evolve as a part of our culture.
To visualize our data, we want high interactivity so one can have filter by one’s own interest in this high dimensional space. Therefore, our work will be presented in the form of an interactive blog. 

## Research questions
We will guide our work with the following questions:

- How is the perception of certain topics evolving throughout time and within genres?
- How is the relationship between topics and locations characterized in different music genres?
- Is there a correlation between the complexity of lyrics and specific topics? 

## Dataset
Our main dataset is coming from the one called “Million song” that was provided with the project list. As specified in the abstract we will be working on the lyrics with the “musiXmatch” dataset and the “tagtraum” dataset for genres. We might use the “Top MAGD” dataset that gives more music genres, it depends on how performant we manage to be with the first genre dataset. We will also use NLTK to analyse whether the words/sentences that are used are of a positive or negative nature. To get additional specific information from artists, like pictures and origin, we will use Wikidata 

## A list of internal milestones up until project milestone 2

- Establish the sentiment analysis on all the song of our dataset and create a new table
- Append an additional rating to the positive/negative one that is provided by NLTK
- Find the most powerful way to store and look up all our data
- Find how we can clean our dataset

19.11

- Explore possibilities for the data visualization

#### Options to consider:

- Extend our work to others languages than English

## Questions for TAa
- Are we allowed to use pictures for representation of artists if our work is not publicly published? Copyright-wise, how does this work?
- Is the content we have enough to make a project? 
- Is the idea fitting to the “social good” topic?
- In terms of visualization and analysis, which aspect is the most important one?
