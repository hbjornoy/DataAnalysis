The quantile distribution however give a more nuanced information about the most common unemployment numbers. The LEgend with thresholds can itself say alot about the distribution of unemploymentnumbers across nations.\n",

    "#### Explaining our choices in visualization:\n",
    "- Why we used the same linear thresholds for jobseeker and unemployment\n",
    "    - By using the same threshold it is easier to compare intuitively compare the numbers between the jobseeker map and the unemployment map. If they had different threshold the colours would be connected to another scale. The disadvantage is that one potentially don't use the whole scale. We chose to use linear thresholds since it would be nonsensical to use thresholds based on quantiles. Since we are working on different distributions of number it wouldn't make any sense unless we did separate from each one\n",
    "- Why we choose to use layers to visualize the difference different ages\n",
    "    - We chose to use layers to because it is easier to see differences when switching the layer and the image is still. Much better for comparing the same canton and the individual changes.\n",
    "- We wanted float threshold instead of integers\n",
    "    - The folium library has its limitations. If you don't define a threshold_scale in choropleth then you get nice thresholds with decimals. But if you define your threshold that is not an opportunity. We would love for it to be linear. Now that it is not linear the spacing between the threshold is in the range of 1 to 2, which is a big difference. This makes the viewer very dependant on checking the thresholds on the legend to really understand the colouring.\n",
    "- why we choose \"BuPu\" colour gradient\n",
    "    - We started with having an 'OrRd' colour gradient. We thought the red would be a good indicator of negative effect. But we had trouble differentiating very strong red colours and therefore used \"BuPu\" which is much better for differentiating similar colours. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Comments on data:\n",
    "- One can clearly see that it is a trend that the western part of Switzerland both has higher unemployment and jobseeking rates. Even though a map is not the best visualization tool to make conclusion about correlation, there is clearly a correlation between unemployment and jobseekers\n",
